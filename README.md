# aki-plugin-manager

Aki is a fast, lightweight plugin manager for Node.js applications. It 
supports finding, downloading, and loading packages dynamically at
runtime, even on webpack-enabled configurations.

Aki currently only retrieves packages from npm, although alternative
sources may be added in the future.
